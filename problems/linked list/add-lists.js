// add lists
// Write a function, addLists, that takes in the head of two linked lists, each representing a number.The nodes of the linked lists contain digits as values.The nodes in the input lists are reversed; this means that the least significant digit of the number is the head.The function should return the head of a new linked listed representing the sum of the input lists.The output list should have its digits reversed as well.

// Say we wanted to compute 621 + 354 normally.The sum is 975:

// 621
//     + 354
// -----
//     975

// Then, the reversed linked list format of this problem would appear as:

// 1 -> 2 -> 6
//     + 4 -> 5 -> 3
// --------------
//     5 -> 7 -> 9
